# P5.js
This repository contains set of simulations/animations made using the P5.js library.

- `carsFollowPath` - Cars navigate through a path while avoiding the path boundary and other cars.
- `fireworks` - Randomly generated fireworks animation.
- `flappyBird` - A genetic algorithm based AI plays the flappy bird game.
- `flowField` - Boids move through a flow field while avoiding collision with other boids.
- `foodPoison` - Multiple genetic algorithm based AI agents roam a randomly generately world with food and poison and overtime learns to navigate, avoid poison and thus, stays alive till long.
- `catMouse` - Simulation of the classical 'cat n mouse' problem, where the mouse moves along a straight line and the cat starts orthogonal to the mouse and chases it.
- `smartRockets` - Rockets controlled by a genetic algorithm navigate learn to navigate through a maze and adapt when the maze is altered.
